# About the SGC Open Chemistry Networks Initiative

If you're new to the Open Chemistry Networks (OCN) initiative from the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) then start here - you're in the right place. You can find a description of what OCN is, press about the initiative and updates. 

In outline, OCN is a way to connect synthetic chemists around the world (people who make molecules) with biologists at the SGC (who evaluate those molecules) to accelerate science towards new molecules ("chemical probes") that help the development of new medicines. Everything is in the open (everyone can see everything) and nothing will be patented.

You can read more on the SGC website itself: [the outline](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks), [the FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq) and the full [Terms and Conditions](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use). You can sign up for the newsletters [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yeWV6t7gmqgUiTHfn2LUNtGHup1tKnRpV2a6M3sFPdI/viewform?edit_requested=true).

You're currently looking at one of the project pages on Github, which is where the nuts and bolts of many of the projects can be found.

If you're looking for advice on how to do things, you need the [TechOps repository](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/Chemistry_TechOps_HowTo). If you're after the projects themselves, they're [here](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium).
